# NFT Buddy
Grade 12 Culminating project for ICS4UA written in Java in Eclipse. It is a program that allows the user to tokenize a file using Hedera. It also includes a market, where it simulates the exchange of non-fungible tokens for hbars.

## Token Creation
To allow the program to access the file, place it inside the images source folder. Then, follow the program instructions to create the NFT on the hashgraph and receive a link to the file on IPFS (https://ipfs.io/).

## Market
View a collection of created NFTs here. Type "prev" or "next" to go to another page, or type the number of an NFT to view the information about it. Buying an NFT is as simple as typing "buy", and the token will be transferred onto the temporary customer account.

## My NFTs
The NFTs bought by the temporary account are displayed here. Type the number of the NFT to view its information. Once the program is closed, these tokens will disappear.
