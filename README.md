# NFT Buddy
Grade 12 Culminating project for ICS4UA written in Java in Eclipse. It is a program that allows the user to tokenize a file using Hedera Token Service. It also includes a market, where it simulates the exchange of non-fungible tokens for hbars.

## Token Creation
To allow the program to access the file, place it inside the images source folder. Then, follow the program instructions to create the NFT and receive a link to the file on IPFS (https://ipfs.io/).
